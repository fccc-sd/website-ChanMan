       <!--a description of where I was born, the schools I've went to and where I live-->
        <h2>About Me</h2>
          
<p> I was born in Hicksville Ohio, but I moved to and from Hicksville a lot.
I have moved between Florida, Ohio, and Indiana the most. I have been to a lot of different schools
throughout Ohio and Indiana however I only attended 1 in Florida. I have been wanting to come to fourcouty since 
middle school. then when my sister came to fourcounty she talked to me about certain aspects of the school and
 I chose a lab that I wanted to be in, Computer programming and game design. Then when we got to visit fourcounty lasy
 year I made sure that this would be the one I wanted and I applied.

                and my 15 year old sister have the same disgusting dad however my older sister 
                and my other little sister have different dads
                each of which were scumbags. My mother is 37, she was born in Hicksville
                just like me and all three of my sisters. She graduated highschool 
                and then went on to graduate collage with her batchler's degree while
                taking care of my older sister. After that she decided to work in a factory
                because she couldn't handle people that well. She met my "father" in a factory
                in Hicksville. She ended up asking him to marry her. They were married for 10 years and 
                my mother then became a stay at home mom in her 20s. My father was very 
                manipulative and yelled at her over every little thing. Then when she finally 
                made it out of the marrage she picked herself back up and started working
                again. For like 6 months she was couch surfing and my 2 sisters had to stay with my father while I got 
                sent to my grandmother (his mom) because my father didn't like me that much. 
                After the 6 months she started renting a house at which point we all came back
                to live with her. And then she met another scumbag at another factory in hicksville 
                but this scumbag was 13 years older than her to put that into perspective, when she
                was going into kindergarden he was going into his senior year in highschool.
                she was with 2 other scumbags that both cheated on her before him but they were less memorable. 
                anyways while she was with him they had a child named Charleigh so not everything 
                that came from that relationship was bad. My father is listed as a scumbag and disgusting
                for a few different reasons 1 because he did some "not school appropriate" 
                stuff to my sister from the ages of 13-16. 2 He always asked my mother for more 
                money than what she needed to give him for child support including paying
                for a trip to florida for my sisters, my father, his new girlfriend, and her 2 kids. 
                3 he came from a family full of scumbags. 4 He isn't faithful to anyone. 
                He tried to text other girls all the time even when he was married to my mom.
                Including hitting on her best friend and doing the no school appropriate stuff
                to my older sister while they were married. 5 He always yelled at everyone for everything. 
                I don't think I have any memories of him not yelling. 6 He was drunk often. I don't talk to his
                family anymore because they ignore my sister even though they had been her grandparents, aunts, uncles, and cousins 
                too since she was 5 and Marshall (my father) adopted her.

<!--my current friend group and a bit about them-->
            <h2>Friends</h2>
            <p>My friends currently include <em>Devon Smith, Alyssa Costilla</em> (we refer to her as 


                
                
                <span id="God">

                ), <em>Alex </em> last name too long to remember,
                <em> Hayden Ferarr</em>, and <em>Joeseph Greer</em>.
                I've known devon since 7th grade and we've been friends since then, we were the only 2 trombones players in band and Alex was also
                 in band at the time but I didn't really know him all that well. Joeseph I met back in 2nd Grade, I don't really remember how. 
                 I met everyone else once I got into highschool. My freshman year me and joseph sat with the rest at lunch and  we all became pretty close friends.

      <!--what I enjoy to do in my free time-->
            <h2>Hobbies</h2>
            <p>I like to play videogames (obviously), I used to ride my bike all the time and for half of
             my freshman year and my entire sopmore year I worked out. I also watch anime and I used
              to have an app on my phone the let me animate frame by frame and I'd always take up like 500 frames. 
              I used premade characters that I could just move the joints or whole figure then I'd set the playback speed to 60
              frames per second and it'd be a short little animation. I think the app was called "stick node" or
               something like that. I played football my sophmore year but I was awful. 
               I also watch anime and making fun of my friends (they do the same to me).

            <h2>Interesting Facts</h2>
        
        <p>Out of all of my family members I am closest to <em><strong>Elijah Sanchez</strong></em> who is in the other IT Academy
class and my little sister <em><strong>Charleigh</strong></em>. I didn't like the school in florida (I was in 1st grade) because another
 student in my class was playing games on his computer and I told him that he needed to work on something or
  I'd tell the teacher, He said that if I told on him that he'd chop my fingers off with his safety scissors.
   I haven't snitched since. <br> <br>
